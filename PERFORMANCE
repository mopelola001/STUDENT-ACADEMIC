# STUDENT-ACADEMIC
This dashboard analyses academic data from 1,000 students, revealing important insights into the factors influencing performance. Study hours alone do not guarantee success â€” engagement quality and supportive environments like extracurriculars and educated households play a significant role in academic performance.

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
This project analyzes academic performance data from 1,000 students to identify patterns and correlations that can help improve educational outcomes. 

### Objective of the Project
To assess the influence of demographics, parental background, and lifestyle factors on studentsâ€™ academic performance. This includes exploring variables such as gender, attendance, study hours, and parent education.

### Problem Being Addressed
Why do students with similar study patterns and learning environments perform differently? This analysis aims to identify root causes and improve academic planning strategies.

### Key Datasets and Methodologies
- **Dataset Size:** 1,000 student records
- **Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts)
- **Techniques Applied:**
  - Aggregation and grouping using Pivot Tables
  - Visualizations (Bar Charts, Donut Charts, Pie Charts)
  - Summary statistics via KPI cards

## 2. Story of Data

### Data Source
Presumably from an academic institutionâ€™s internal student management system.

### Data Collection Process
Captured through academic records, surveys, and automated systems measuring student attendance and engagement.

### Data Structure
- **Rows:** Individual student records
- **Columns:** Variables like `gender`, `parent education`, `study hours`, `scores`, `final result`, etc.

### Important Features and Their Significance
- `Final Result`: Indicates pass or fail
- `Math/Reading/Writing Scores`: Academic outcome measures
- `Study Hours` and `Attendance`: Indicators of student effort
- `Parent Education`: Socioeconomic factor

### Data Limitations or Biases
- No insight into teaching quality or student motivation
- Study hours may not account for quality of study time
- The dataset reflects a single academic term

## 3. Data Splitting and Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate entries
- Standardized text values
- Checked score consistency and attendance ranges

### Handling Missing Values
- No visible nulls; assumed complete dataset
- Excelâ€™s IFERROR or AVERAGE used where applicable if gaps existed

### Data Transformations
- Summarized study hours and scores using Pivot Tables
- Grouped parent education levels for comparison

### Data Splitting
- **Dependent Variable:** `Final Result`
- **Independent Variables:** `Scores`, `Attendance`, `Parental Education`, etc.

### Industry Context
Applies to the **Education Sector**, particularly school administration and curriculum development.

### Stakeholders
- School Management
- Teachers and Advisors
- Parents
- Educational Planners

### Value to the Industry
Supports data-driven decision-making in resource allocation, academic interventions, and personalized student support.

## 4. Pre-Analysis

### Key Trends Identified
- **Top Gender:** Female (326 students)
- **Most Common Parent Education:** Bachelor's Degree (274 students)
- **Average Attendance:** 90%
- Slightly more students failed (51%) despite longer study hours.

### Potential Correlations
- Extra-curricular activities linked with higher scores.
- Higher parental education associated with better academic performance.

### Initial Insights
- Internet access slightly more prevalent among males.
- Study hours alone do not predict success.

---

## 5. In-Analysis

### Unconfirmed Insights
- Participation in extra activities may boost academic performance.
- Longer study hours do not always result in passing.

### Recommendations
- Encourage extracurricular involvement
- Focus on study quality vs. quantity
- Support lower-educated parents with engagement programs

### Excel Tools Used
- Pivot Tables for summarization
- Pivot Charts (Bar, Donut, Pie)
- COUNTIF, SUMIF, AVERAGE for value derivation

---

## âœ… 6. Post-Analysis and Insights

### Key Findings
- Students with extra activities had higher academic scores and attendance.
- Bachelorâ€™s degree parents were linked with the highest overall student performance (62K total scores).
- Pass rate is lower despite increased study hours, suggesting study methods need improvement.

### Comparison with Initial Hypotheses
- Assumption that higher study hours lead to passing was disproved.
- Internet access had less impact than expected.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ 7. Recommendations and Observations

### Actionable Insights
- Promote structured extracurriculars
- Educate parents on learning support strategies
- Focus on learning efficiency

### Business Optimizations
- Provide learning tools to students lacking home internet access
- Adjust school strategies to focus on cognitive engagement, not just study time

### Unexpected Outcomes
- Study time not a strong predictor of success
- Extra-curricular activities provided indirect academic benefit

---

## ðŸ§¾ 8. Conclusion

### Key Learnings
- Academic performance depends on multiple interlinked factors.
- Extracurricular involvement and parental background are significant.
- Attendance is a valuable indicator but must be paired with engagement.

### Limitations
- Dataset may exclude psychological, emotional, and behavioral data
- No year-over-year trend analysis

### Future Research
- Longitudinal studies
- Integration of qualitative variables
- Subject-specific performance breakdown
